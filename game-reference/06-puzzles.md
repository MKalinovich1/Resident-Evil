## Overview

Puzzles are a core pillar of Resident Evil's gameplay, alongside combat and resource management. They serve multiple purposes:

## Puzzle Design Principles (for Game Development)

1. **Key-Lock Design:** Most puzzles ultimately follow a find-item → use-item-in-slot pattern, but dress it up with environmental context
2. **Backtracking:** Many puzzles require items from distant areas, forcing the player to traverse dangerous corridors again
3. **Inventory Tension:** Puzzle items take up inventory slots, creating dilemmas (carry the puzzle item or extra ammo?)
4. **Multi-Step Chains:** Complex puzzles (Moonlight Sonata → Golden Emblem → Clock → Shield Key) span multiple rooms and require planning
5. **Observation Rewards:** Examining items closely (rotating, pressing hidden buttons) is required — teaches players to investigate everything
6. **Optional Depth:** Some puzzles (V-JOLT) are optional but reward the prepared player with an easier boss fight
7. **Environmental Integration:** Puzzles feel part of the mansion's architecture, not arbitrary game obstacles
