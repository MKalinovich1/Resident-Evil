# Resident Evil (1996) — Enemies & Bosses Reference

## Standard Enemies

### Zombies
- **Origin:** Mansion researchers/staff infected with T-Virus
- **Appearance:** Decaying humanoids in lab coats or casual clothes, grey/green skin, milky eyes, shambling gait
- **Behavior:**
  - Slow, shambling movement — wander aimlessly or stand idle
  - Attracted by sound and proximity
  - Cannot open doors (doors are always safe barriers)
  - Some play dead on the ground and grab the player's ankle when walked over
  - Can appear in groups of 2–5, making corridors very dangerous
- **Attacks:**
  - **Bite** (grab + chomp) — moderate damage, player must wiggle free
  - **Vomit/Bile spit** — low damage, short range acid projectile
- **Weaknesses:** Headshots with shotgun can decapitate. 3–5 handgun shots to kill. Shotgun at close range = instant down
- **Where Found:** Throughout mansion 1F and 2F, guardhouse, caves
- **Side-Scroller Notes:** The bread-and-butter enemy. Slow approach, grab attack, can appear in groups. Variety through different costumes (lab coats, suits, casual wear).

### Cerberus (Zombie Dogs)
- **Origin:** Doberman Pinschers infected with T-Virus via Umbrella experiments
- **Appearance:** Skinless/partially decomposed dogs, exposed muscle tissue, glowing eyes
- **Behavior:**
  - Very fast movement — sprint toward player
  - Can leap/lunge across distance
  - Often appear suddenly (through windows, around corners)
  - Travel in packs of 2–3
  - Brief stagger after being shot — provides a window to fire again
- **Attacks:**
  - **Lunge/Pounce** — jumps at player, knocking them down
  - **Bite** — quick snapping attack
  - **Tackle** — runs into player to knock them off balance
- **Weaknesses:** Relatively low HP (2–3 handgun shots). Stagger easily. Shotgun kills in one blast.
- **Where Found:** Forest (opening), mansion courtyard, certain mansion corridors (window crashes), underground tunnels
- **Side-Scroller Notes:** Fast-moving threat that lunges. Great for ambush/surprise moments, especially window-crashing jump scares.

### Hunters (Hunter α)
- **Origin:** Purpose-built B.O.W. — reptilian/human hybrids created by Umbrella using T-Virus on fertilized human eggs
- **Appearance:** Large, muscular humanoid reptiles. Green/brown scaled skin, hunched posture, massive claws, no visible eyes, wide frog-like mouth
- **Behavior:**
  - Fast, aggressive — actively hunt the player
  - Can leap great distances
  - Make a distinctive chirping/screeching sound (audio warning)
  - Replace zombies in the mansion during the second half of the game
  - Far more dangerous than any standard enemy
- **Attacks:**
  - **Claw swipe** — heavy damage
  - **Jumping slash** — leaps and slashes mid-air
  - **DECAPITATION** — if player health is in "Danger" (red), Hunters can perform an instant-kill decapitation attack. Screen goes red, game over.
- **Weaknesses:** Tough — requires 3–4 shotgun blasts or several magnum rounds. Acid rounds from grenade launcher are very effective. Can be staggered by shotgun.
- **Where Found:** Mansion (after returning from guardhouse), underground tunnels, lab areas
- **Side-Scroller Notes:** Mid-tier elite enemy. Should be fast, aggressive, with a leap attack. The decapitation one-hit-kill at low health is iconic and should be preserved as a mechanic.

### Crows (Infected Crows)
- **Origin:** Birds infected by eating T-Virus contaminated carrion

- **Attacks:**
  - **Acid spit/venom spray** — ranged attack, can poison

---
