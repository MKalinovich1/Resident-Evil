## Full Story — Act by Act

### Act 1: The Forest & Arrival (Opening Cinematic)

1. Alpha Team arrives by helicopter in the Arklay Forest at night.
2. They discover Bravo Team's crashed helicopter — no survivors visible.
3. Joseph Frost is brutally attacked and killed by **Cerberus** (zombie dogs) that burst from the trees.
4. The remaining team members — Chris, Jill, Wesker, and Barry — are chased toward a nearby mansion.
5. Brad Vickers panics in the helicopter and **flies away**, stranding the team.
6. The survivors flee into the **Spencer Mansion** entrance hall.

> **Tonal note:** The opening FMV uses live-action actors and is famously campy, with stilted dialogue ("What IS this?!" / "Don't open that door!"). This B-movie quality became part of the game's charm.

### Act 2: Exploring the Mansion (1F & 2F)

7. Inside the grand entrance hall, the team splits up to investigate.
8. **The First Zombie Scene:** The player enters a corridor and finds a zombie crouched over Kenneth Sullivan's body. It slowly turns its head — one of gaming's most iconic horror moments.
9. The player explores the mansion's first and second floors, finding it full of:
   - Locked doors requiring specific keys (Sword Key, Armor Key, Shield Key, Helmet Key)
   - Environmental puzzles (crests, emblems, paintings, armor statues)
   - Traps (collapsing ceilings, poison gas, shotgun trap)
10. The player discovers scattered **files and diaries** from the mansion's former inhabitants — researchers for the **Umbrella Corporation**. These reveal:
    - The mansion is a secret research facility disguised as a country estate
    - Umbrella was developing biological weapons using the **T-Virus**
    - The virus leaked, infecting researchers and turning them into zombies
11. **The Keeper's Diary** — A researcher's journal documenting his slow transformation into a zombie, ending with the legendary entry: *"Itchy. Tasty."*
12. **The Moonlight Sonata Puzzle:** In the bar area, the player must find two halves of sheet music and play Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" on a piano to open a secret room containing a Golden Emblem. (Jill plays it herself; Chris needs Rebecca to practice and perform it.)
13. The **Shotgun Trap:** In a room with a shotgun on the wall, taking it triggers a ceiling trap. Jill is saved by Barry; Chris must swap in a broken shotgun.
14. **Dogs through the windows (L-shaped corridor):** Walking down a quiet corridor, Cerberus dogs suddenly **crash through the windows** — the game's most famous jump scare.

### Act 3: The Guardhouse / Residence

15. Through the mansion's back exit and courtyard, the player reaches a separate **dormitory/guardhouse** connected by underground tunnels.
16. Here the player finds more files about Umbrella's experiments and encounters:
    - Giant spiders (Web Spinners)
    - Sharks (Neptune) in a flooded aqua ring
17. **Boss: Plant 42** — A massive mutated plant has taken over the guardhouse attic. The player can optionally weaken it by creating **V-JOLT chemical** (mixing chemicals in a lab). Then a direct boss fight occurs.
18. After defeating Plant 42 and exploring the guardhouse, the player collects key items needed to progress deeper into the mansion.

### Act 4: Return to the Mansion — The Hunter Surprise

19. Upon returning to the mansion from the guardhouse, the previously "safe" environment has **dramatically changed** — the mansion is now infested with **Hunters**, fast reptilian bio-weapons that can **decapitate the player** in one hit.
20. This is one of the game's most brilliant design moments — areas the player had felt safe in are now far more dangerous.
21. **Boss: Yawn (second encounter)** — The giant snake is fought again, this time as a mandatory battle.

### Act 5: The Underground Caves & Lab

22. After collecting the four **Death Masks** (from puzzle rooms throughout the mansion) and placing them on a coffin, the player gains access to underground areas.
23. In the caves beneath the mansion, the player encounters:
    - Giant spiders (Black Tiger boss)
    - Boulder traps
    - Underground tunnels
24. **Enrico Marini's death:** The player finds the Bravo Team captain wounded. He begins to warn about a **traitor in S.T.A.R.S.** — then is shot dead mid-sentence by an unseen assailant. This is a pivotal mystery moment.
25. The player descends into **Umbrella's underground laboratory**, a high-tech facility beneath the mansion.
26. In the lab, the player finds:
    - Chimera enemies (human-fly hybrids crawling on ceilings)
    - Research notes detailing Umbrella's bio-weapon development
    - Prison cells with failed experiments
    - MO Disk puzzles to unlock computer systems

### Act 6: The Betrayal

27. Deep in the lab, **Albert Wesker reveals himself** as a double agent working for Umbrella.
28. Wesker's true mission:
    - He **lured S.T.A.R.S. into the mansion** to use them as guinea pigs — combat data for testing Umbrella's bio-weapons against trained soldiers
    - He planned to steal Umbrella's research data and the Tyrant for himself
29. **Barry's sub-plot (Jill's campaign):** Wesker had been **blackmailing Barry** by threatening to kill his family, forcing Barry to secretly work against Jill — sabotaging and misleading her. Barry can be saved or lost depending on player choices.
30. Wesker unleashes the **Tyrant (T-002)** — Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapon, a towering humanoid monster with a massive claw growing from its arm and an exposed beating heart.

### Act 7: Tyrant Battle & Self-Destruct

31. The Tyrant **turns on Wesker** and impales him through the chest (he appears to die — this sets up sequels).
32. **First Tyrant boss fight** in the lab — the player battles it using available weapons.
33. After defeating (or staggering) the Tyrant, the player activates the **lab's self-destruct sequence**, starting a countdown timer.
34. The player must escape through the self-destructing lab and mansion to reach the **helipad on the roof**.

### Act 8: The Finale — Rooftop
35. On the rooftop helipad, the player signals for evacuation.
36. Brad Vickers finally returns with the helicopter.
37. The Tyrant **BURSTS THROUGH THE GROUND** of the helipad for a final showdown.
38. After the player survives long enough, Brad drops a **Rocket Launcher** from the helicopter.
39. The player picks up the rocket launcher and **destroys the Tyrant** in a massive explosion.
40. The surviving characters board the helicopter and escape.
41. The **Spencer Mansion explodes** as the helicopter flies away into the dawn.

## Key Themes

1. **Corporate corruption** — Umbrella Corporation prioritizes profit over human life
2. **Betrayal & trust** — Wesker's treachery, Barry's compromised loyalty
3. **Hubris of science** — Playing God with viruses leads to catastrophe
4. **Survival against the odds** — Isolated, outgunned, outnumbered
5. **B-movie horror homage** — Cheesy dialogue, over-the-top creatures, haunted mansion setting
